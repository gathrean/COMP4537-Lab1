// DISCLOSURE: I've used ChatGPT to get started with the following code, 
// and I've fixed and tweaked it to make it work for this project along the way.

// MY HOSTED WEBSITE: https://comp4537-lab1-gathrean.vercel.app/

// In this lab I gained some experience with working with local storage and 
// it kinda gave me some ideas on how chat messaging works (though it's more complex than this).

// I also learned on retrieving and parsing an object from local storage to show up on another page.
